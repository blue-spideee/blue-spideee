### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a KM Fahim Mahmud from Bangladesh. Iâ€™m a designer who codes. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with React and Python; I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
